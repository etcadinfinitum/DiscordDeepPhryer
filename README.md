# Deep Phryer

*A Discord bot built in Python*

### Get your own Phryer

Go through the steps to create and authorize a bot on a Discord server. Steps are described [here](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/make-discord-bot-python), among other places.

The script expects your bot's authorization token to be in a file called `creds.py`. Create this file, and add a single line like so:
```TOKEN='XXXXXX_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE_XXXXXXXXX'```

The bot requires Wand and imagemagick to be installed. Make sure you have the necessary packages installed; read the installation docs [here](http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.1/guide/install.html).

### Credits

This bot is licensed under GPL v3.0. Go forth and propogate, but do not privatize. See the LICENSE docs for more information.

Huge props to [Finn](https://github.com/thefinn93) for building most of the foundation for the bot and for letting me add support for GIFs. The original bot code is [here](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/deep-fried-sigger).
